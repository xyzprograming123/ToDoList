# One of my homework assignments

Recieved a react "shell" code base that does not have any functionality.

Implemented
Markup: *Made the description, due_date, and status editable
        *Made a delete-list-comfirmation modal 
        *Made the todo-list move up and down by clicking the arrow
        *Made most changes undoable and redoable using transactions
        *Made the add item button functional
        *Incorporated fool-proof design into this project.
